JoyJoy Care - Terms & Conditions Addendum
Payment & Invoicing via PayStream - Fortnightly

1. Engagement & Contractual Status
All temporary staff are engaged by JoyJoy Care on a zero-hour basis through our preferred umbrella company partner, PayStream. Staff are not employees of JoyJoy Care but are contracted via PayStream, which acts as their employer of record. As per the zero-hour model, staff are not guaranteed minimum hours and are free to accept or decline work offered without penalty.

2. Timesheet Submission & Verification
All workers must submit approved timesheets via the JoyJoy Care portal or PayStream's platform by 12pm Monday following the week worked. Timesheets must be validated by the care home or client manager before payments are processed. Delays in verification may result in deferred payment.

3. Self-Billing & Invoicing
JoyJoy Care operates a self-billing arrangement with PayStream and its contracted workers. Invoices are generated on behalf of the umbrella company (PayStream) once verified timesheets are received. Staff do not need to raise invoices directly. The self-billed invoices are sent to PayStream fortnightly.

4. Payroll Schedule
PayStream will process payments to workers on a fortnightly basis, subject to:
- Receipt of a valid, authorised timesheet.
- Worker compliance with onboarding and documentation (e.g. right to work, DBS clearance).
Payment will be made via Faster Payments or BACS, typically by the end of the fortnightly payment period.

5. Deductions
All statutory deductions (e.g. income tax, employee NICs) and umbrella company fees will be managed by PayStream in line with HMRC and IR35 guidelines. JoyJoy Care has no responsibility for PAYE deductions for umbrella workers.

6. Holiday Pay & Statutory Entitlements
All applicable holiday pay, pension, and statutory benefits (e.g. SSP, SMP) are handled by PayStream in accordance with UK employment law. Workers are encouraged to contact PayStream directly regarding any entitlements.

7. Right to Substitute
Where appropriate, JoyJoy Care reserves the right to assign a suitable substitute if the contracted worker is unavailable, in line with the zero-hour flexibility.

8. Termination of Engagement
Either party may terminate the engagement without notice, subject to any assignment-specific obligations. No compensation is due if no work is offered or if shifts are cancelled by the client, unless contractual cancellation terms apply.
