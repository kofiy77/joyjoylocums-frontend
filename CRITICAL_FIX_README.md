# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX: Asset Import Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
The live site was broken because pages were using direct URL paths (`/src/assets/...`) instead of ES6 imports for images. In Vite production builds, assets get processed and renamed with hashes.

## âœ… SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Fixed All Pages to Use ES6 Imports:

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
backgroundImage: `url('/src/assets/image.jpg')`
```

**After (FIXED):**
```javascript
import heroImage from "@/assets/image.jpg";
// ...
backgroundImage: `url(${heroImage})`
```

### Updated Files:
- âœ… `home.tsx` - Added `import homeHeroImage from "@/assets/image_1753233763433.jpeg"`
- âœ… `gp-locums.tsx` - Added `import gpHeroImage from "@/assets/shutterstock_430385620_1753232327688.jpg"`  
- âœ… `nurse-practitioner-locums.tsx` - Added `import npHeroImage from "@/assets/image_1753233114194.jpeg"`
- âœ… `allied-healthcare-professionals.tsx` - Added `import ahpHeroImage from "@/assets/image_1753633159610.png"`
- âœ… `pcn-locums.tsx` - Added `import pcnHeroImage from "@/assets/IMG_1667_1753631216038.jpeg"`
- âœ… `clinical-pharmacist-locums.tsx` - Added `import cpHeroImage from "@/assets/shutterstock_2539516065_1753567420681.jpg"`

## Build Verification
âœ… Local build completed successfully
âœ… All hero images processed with proper hashes
âœ… Total build size: 47MB with optimized assets

## Upload Instructions
1. Replace the 6 page files in your GitHub repository
2. Redeploy on Netlify
3. All hero images will now display correctly on joyjoylocums.co.uk

This fix resolves the systemic asset loading issue that was causing the broken styling on the live deployment.
